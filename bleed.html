<h1>I cry for the average Kenyan</h1>

<p>For the second time in less than a week, reading a local newspaper made me shed tears, literally. 
The plight of a widow who lost her husband in unfamiliar circumstances welled up my eyes. I couldn't look at her photo again on the front page.
A tear rolling down from one of her blood-shot eyes. She has suffered too much, that she doesn't wipe her tears anymore.
Neighbours and friends have also stopped consoling her, for the uncertainity and hopelessness surrounding her ordeal.<br/><u>A Ksh.1.4m hospital bill.</u></p>
<p>With the current state of affairs, the number is no longer an eye-widener. The <font size="+1"><strong>injustice</strong></font> done to her is unfathomable and intenable. 
Nothing should hinder such malice and disrespect for human life. A reputable hospital conceding to the evils of the world. The feminine
touch in it's name is supposed to offer care and comfort to any patient walking through their door.<br/> But this wasn't the case this time.</p>
<p>A questionable inflated bill. Despite the willingness of the family to settle the matter out of court, the hospital continued to show impenitence
and its bullying character to the financially handicapped family.</p>
<p>If only some funds had been 'misdirected' to her account.</p>
<p>Today, I saw the queue of job-seeking young Kenyans outside one of the most prestigious hotel in the country. Hakuna Kazi KE. But money seems to
floating around in some places. Cuban doctors are set to land today. 2016 Kenyan graduate doctors are denied opportunities in local hospitals. Reason: no money
to pay their wages. I'm sure the Cuban doctors aren't coming all this way for pennies.</p>
<p>They claim to be specialized. Wouldn't it be better to sponsor our local graduates to specialize in certain areas? </p>

<p>In their drones they alighted from the so called designated bus termini kilometres outside the CBD. Walking to their work places, hospitals and hustles.
But the policy makers are ddriven to their office entrance. Absolute rubbish. Till th day the lawmakers and policy implementers share the same jav,
hospital services, financial constraints, salary caps an dmany other common citizen struggle, nothing they say or do will help us.</p>
